      "description": "My name is Harvey Francois. I am a software developer and student here at Code Fellows, class 301. I have a fascination with machine learning, AI, and robotics. I had my first experience with coding in college, in a robotics class programming robots and I loved it. This is why I have a real interest in learning Python. I heard of Code Fellows through a friend of mine that went through the program and he told me to try it out. I have one major goal for myself and that is a career doing something that I enjoy doing and that coding. So I decided to make a career change. Now I am at Code Fellows and enjoying every moment of it.",
